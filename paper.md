## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The field of cryptography has evolved significantly from the mechanical cipher machines of the early 20th century to the sophisticated digital encryption algorithms of today. Classical rotor machines, most notably the German Enigma machine used during World War II, demonstrated the power of mechanical complexity in creating secure communications. However, these historical systems had inherent weaknesses that were eventually exploited by cryptanalysts.

The Dynamic Rotor Cipher algorithm presented in this thesis represents a modern interpretation of rotor-based encryption, incorporating contemporary cryptographic techniques to address the limitations of classical systems while maintaining the conceptual elegance of rotor mechanics.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional rotor cipher machines suffered from several critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Predictable rotor stepping**: Classical machines used mechanical stepping mechanisms that created patterns exploitable by cryptanalysts
2. **Limited keyspace**: Physical constraints limited the number of possible rotor configurations
3. **Static permutations**: Once configured, the internal wirings remained constant throughout the encryption process
4. **Mechanical limitations**: Physical wear and manufacturing tolerances introduced predictable biases

### 1.3 Objectives

This thesis aims to:

1. Present a novel dynamic rotor cipher algorithm that addresses classical vulnerabilities
2. Analyze the cryptographic properties and security characteristics of the proposed system
3. Evaluate the algorithm's performance and practical implementation considerations
4. Compare the system's strengths and weaknesses against both classical and modern encryption methods

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Historical Rotor Machines

Rotor cipher machines were first developed in the early 1900s, with significant contributions from inventors such as Arthur Scherbius (Enigma), Arvid Damm (Cryptograph), and Edward Hebern. These machines operated on the principle of polyalphabetic substitution, where each rotor provided a different substitution alphabet that changed with each character encrypted.

The Enigma machine, perhaps the most famous rotor cipher, used three to five rotors, each containing 26 electrical contacts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. The rotors would step in an odometer-like fashion, creating a complex polyalphabetic cipher with a theoretical keyspace of approximately 10^114 configurations.

### 2.2 Cryptanalysis of Classical Rotor Systems

The breaking of the Enigma cipher by Allied cryptanalysts, notably at Bletchley Park, revealed several fundamental weaknesses in classical rotor systems:

1. **Crib attacks**: Known plaintext segments could be used to deduce rotor positions
2. **Stepping patterns**: Predictable rotor advancement created exploitable patterns
3. **Reflector weaknesses**: The reflector ensured no letter could encrypt to itself, reducing the effective keyspace
4. **Daily key distribution**: The need to distribute daily keys created operational vulnerabilities

### 2.3 Modern Symmetric Encryption

Contemporary symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) utilize sophisticated mathematical operations including substitution boxes (S-boxes), permutation layers, and round functions. These systems achieve security through:

1. **Confusion**: Making the relationship between the key and ciphertext as complex as possible
2. **Diffusion**: Ensuring that small changes in plaintext or key result in significant changes in ciphertext
3. **Non-linearity**: Using mathematical operations that prevent linear cryptanalysis

## 3. Algorithm Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Core Algorithm Structure

The Dynamic Rotor Cipher algorithm consists of several key components:

#### 3.1.1 Character Set Definition
```
LETTERS = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 .,!?()'
ROTOR_CHARS = 'abcd'
```

The algorithm operates on a 69-character alphabet encompassing lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and common punctuation marks. The rotor key is constrained to a 4-character alphabet ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') to ensure uniform distribution and predictable offset calculations.

#### 3.1.2 Rotor Key Structure

The rotor key consists of exactly 32 characters, each selected from the ROTOR_CHARS set. This design provides:
- **Deterministic length**: Eliminates variable-length key vulnerabilities
- **Controlled complexity**: 4^32 possible rotor configurations (approximately 1.8 × 10^19)
- **Balanced distribution**: Each rotor position contributes equally to the encryption process

#### 3.1.3 Dynamic Offset Generation

The core innovation of this algorithm lies in its dynamic offset generation function:

```javascript
async function dynamicOffset(i, auxKey, seed) {
    const baseOffset = rotorCharOffset(auxKey[i % auxKey.length]);
    const seedInput = `${seed}:${i}`;
    const hashDigest = await sha256(seedInput);
    const prngValue = parseInt(hashDigest.slice(0, 2), 16) % ROTOR_CHARS.length;
    return (baseOffset + prngValue) % LETTERS.length;
}
```

This function combines:
1. **Position-dependent base offset**: Derived from the rotor key at position i
2. **Cryptographic hash**: SHA-256 applied to seed concatenated with position
3. **Pseudo-random value**: Extracted from the hash digest to introduce unpredictability

### 3.2 Encryption Process

The encryption algorithm processes each character individually:

1. **Character validation**: Non-alphabet characters are passed through unchanged
2. **Offset calculation**: Dynamic offset computed using position, rotor key, and seed
3. **Character shifting**: Original character shifted by calculated offset within the alphabet
4. **Modular arithmetic**: Wrap-around ensured using modulo operation

### 3.3 Decryption Process

Decryption follows the identical process with negated offsets:
- Same offset calculation as encryption
- Negative shift applied to reverse the encryption transformation
- Modular arithmetic ensures proper wrap-around for negative values

## 4. Security Analysis

### 4.1 Key Space Analysis

The Dynamic Rotor Cipher keyspace consists of:
- **Rotor key**: 4^32 ≈ 1.8 × 10^19 possible configurations
- **Seed**: Arbitrary string length provides effectively unlimited possibilities
- **Combined keyspace**: Computationally infeasible to exhaust through brute force

### 4.2 Cryptographic Properties

#### 4.2.1 Confusion
The algorithm achieves confusion through:
- SHA-256 hash function creating non-linear relationships between seed and offsets
- Position-dependent calculations preventing pattern recognition
- Variable seed input ensuring key-ciphertext relationship complexity

#### 4.2.2 Diffusion
Diffusion is provided by:
- Position-dependent offset calculations causing avalanche effects
- Character-by-character processing with varying transformations
- Hash function properties ensuring small input changes produce large output changes

Non-linear properties result from:
- Cryptographic hash function SHA-256

- Combined multiplicative and additive offset components

### 4.3 Resistance to Classical Attacks

#### 4.3.1 Frequency Analysis
- Position-dependent offsets prevent consistent character mappings
- Variable transformations eliminate statistical patterns
- Large alphabet reduces frequency analysis effectiveness

#### 4.3.2 Known Plaintext Attacks
- Seed-dependent calculations require knowledge of both rotor key and seed
- Hash-based offset generation complicates plaintext-ciphertext relationships
- Position dependency prevents exploitation of known segments

#### 4.3.3 Chosen Plaintext Attacks
- Identical plaintext produces different ciphertext with different seeds
- Position-dependent transformations prevent pattern exploitation
- Hash function properties resist differential analysis

### 4.4 Potential Vulnerabilities

#### 4.4.1 Implementation Weaknesses
- JavaScript implementation may introduce timing vulnerabilities
- Client-side execution exposes algorithm details
- Lack of key derivation function for seed processing

#### 4.4.2 Cryptographic Limitations
- Custom algorithm lacks extensive cryptanalytic scrutiny
- Smaller alphabet size compared to modern binary ciphers
- Sequential processing prevents parallel cryptanalysis resistance
